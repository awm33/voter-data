# PA Voter Data

A work in progress playing with the PA voter registration database.

Data can be [obtained from the PA Department of State](https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/PurchasePAFULLVoterExport.aspx). Downloading this data requires $20 and a PA state ID (driver's license). This data also can not be published online.
